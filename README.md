About
This is a beginner's GOlang project. I have written a program using which you can order food in a restaurant.

Objective

- Trying to learn GO and build a project as a beginner.
- Enhance Go skills and learnings by building project.

Overview

Want to order food!? Well, you have come to the right place(not exactly :P).

This is a program which will help you order food in a restaurant named "Falase Femi".

You can order any item that is there in the menu, and as many times as you want. This program also lets you modify your order by allowing you to update quantity of an item, add an item in the order or delete an item from the order; before generating the final bill.
